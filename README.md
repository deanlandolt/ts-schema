# ts-schema

Model schemas extracted from TypeScript classes.

This library allows you to author your mdoels in a (reasonably large) subset
of typescript and compile them to json-schema. The syntax is far more
succinct than vanilla json-schema, and eventually you could even use the
compiled results in your code.

See `./test` directory for usage.
